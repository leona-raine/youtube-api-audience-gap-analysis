# niche audience gap analysis using youtube api

- youtube api extraction
- real-time data
- filtered niche with visualization that shows the audience gap between yt videos and creators
- problem: many small yt creators struggle to find high-demand topics that aren’t saturated. This project identifies ‘audience gaps’ by analyzing numeric engagement data (views, likes, comments) for a given keyword.
- objective: filter search engine and dashboard deployment data visualization.

## UPDATE
issues to solve:
- using only a single interface to run and circulate .py files
- error handling: "file does not exist/appropriate" handles. save/delete/overwrite functions.
- picking csv files for processing other than manual typing
